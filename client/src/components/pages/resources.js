           <ol>
               <li>
               Identify a problem, challenge or issue in your neighbourhood and be specific about what you want to tackle.
               </li>
               <li>
                Do some research so that you have a good picture of the current situation, then develop and plan how to go about tackling the problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                Get together with others to share your research and explore the problem and potential solutions.

                <li>
                Collaborate with those who might not share your opinions or support your aims so that you can overcome objections and gain different perspectives.
